					<p>Internet is an incredible tool, but it has a dark side. Have you ever gone to a website and been assaulted by a lot of popups asking you to accept cookies?

Are they using black magic? This is what we will be trying to answer today.</p>
					<p>From your lamp to your flip-flops, everything is connected to the Internet these days. No wonder Google is able to know every single thing about you. Let’s do an experiment, just follow these simple steps:</p>
